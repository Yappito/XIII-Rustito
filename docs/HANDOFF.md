# Handoff for the next implementation agent

Updated: **2026-10-04**. Prepared for the user's planned Opus 5.5 continuation.

## User intent

Re-engineer XIII Classic (2003) into Rust using Bevy so it remains playable on modern systems. Use [iw4L](https://github.com/vladtrc/iw4L) as the reference approach. The user's clarification was to import assets from an existing owned game installation, as that project does. The first requested phase was investigation, design documentation and guidelines; this handoff closes that phase.

The environment is primarily Windows with WSL2. A GOG installation lives inside this project, and an additional Steam installation is available. Preserve both. Campaign fidelity is the investigator's default milestone sequence; the user did not explicitly choose it over multiplayer. Direct installation import **was** explicitly preferred.

## Implementation status (updated 2026-10-04)

Implementation started on 2026-10-04 (M0/M1). Work log lives in this section; keep it current.

### Toolchain (installed 2026-10-04, native Windows)

- rustup 1.29.0 with Rust **1.99.0** (`x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`), pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml` (Bevy 0.19.1 MSRV is 1.95).
- Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools (winget `Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools`, VCTools workload): MSVC **14.44.35207**, Windows SDK 10.0.22621 + 10.0.26100.
- No git repository has been initialized yet.

### Cargo workspace

| Crate | Role | State |
|---|---|---|
| `crates/xiii-package` | Bounded, filesystem-free UE2 v100 package reader (no deps) | Summary/GUID/generations, names, imports, exports, object paths, contextual errors; tagged properties in progress |
| `crates/xiii-install` | Read-only installation open/profile detection/case-insensitive logical index (no deps) | Done for GOG + patched Steam; no precedence rule needed (no duplicates found) |
| `crates/xiii-tool` | CLI (`inspect`, `corpus`) | Working |
| `crates/xiii-app` | Bevy 0.19.1 runtime; currently the M0 smoke test | Working natively |

Each crate has a README with verified layouts, evidence and rationale.

### Verified results

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `xiii-tool corpus XIII_Game --compare docs/evidence/gog-inventory.json` | 196/196 packages match (version/licensee, name/import/export counts, per-class counts, sizes); 0 errors |
| Same against Steam + `steam-inventory.json` | 213/213 match; 0 errors |
| Header layout | 36 fixed bytes + 16-byte GUID + i32 generation count G + G×(exports, names); header ends at 56+8G == first table offset in all 409 files; latest generation == table counts in all files; header+tables+export spans cover every byte, no gaps/overlaps |
| Installation profiles | GOG (`system/PC`, `TexturesPC`, flat `Maps`) and SteamPatched (`Textures`, `Maps/BaseSP`/`BaseMP`, 8 `*Plus` packages, "unofficial patch 1.4" credits) detected by content; 0 duplicate logical names in either install; Plage00/01, StaticPlage2, XIIIPersos, XIDMaps, XIII, XIDCine, Engine, Core resolve within their own root |
| Native Bevy smoke (`cargo run -p xiii-app -- --exit-after-secs ...`) | RTX 4090, Vulkan default (DX12 works with `WGPU_BACKEND=dx12`); 1280×720; 8.3 ms vsync / 2.0 ms uncapped dev build; runtime-generated WAV tone plays; screenshot path works; mouse motion captured live. Keyboard/mouse-button events not yet exercised live |
| Unit/integration tests | xiii-package/xiii-tool 27 unit + 1 doc + synthetic corpus test; xiii-install 20 unit + 4 opt-in integration (pass with `XIII_GOG_DIR`/`XIII_STEAM_DIR`); xiii-app 4 |
| Build times (cold) | `cargo build -p xiii-app` 7m14s dev, 4m37s release; ~410 deps; release binary 70 MB |

Opt-in corpus tests: set `XIII_GOG_DIR=P:/AI/XIII/XIII_Game` and `XIII_STEAM_DIR="P:/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/XIII - Classic"` before `cargo test --workspace`; without them they print `SKIPPED`.

### Open questions from this phase

- How the original engine finds GOG `system/PC`/`TexturesPC` when `Default.ini` `Paths=` omits them (likely `PlateForm=0` + `SpecificPackage=`) is unverified.
- Corpus comparison checks sizes and all probe fields, not SHA-256.
- Reader accepts non-minimal/negative-zero compact indices (matches probe).

## Research-phase artifacts (still present)

- `tools/probe_install.py`, `tools/build_evidence.py`, `tools/test_probe_install.py`: Python research probes (standard library only).
- `docs/evidence/`: inventory hashes, class counts, comparisons, focus-package summaries and source-revision metadata. No extracted payloads.
- Ignored `.research/`: downloaded public reference files used in the investigation; not a runtime dependency.
- No original game, editor, UCC or external extractor has been run. Both installations were only read.

## Findings that should shape implementation

1. **Direct package access works at the table level.** All 196 GOG packages and 213 local Steam packages parsed without table/reference/range errors. Versions are 100/50, 100/56, 100/57 and 100/58. Object payloads are still mostly unknown.
2. **The Steam copy is patched.** It contains unofficial patch 1.4 credits and additional `*Plus` packages. Its flattened package layout and `Maps/BaseSP` / `BaseMP` structure differ from GOG. All 64 maps and 99 HX bank/stream files nevertheless match by SHA-256. Do not call this a pristine Steam release or merge it into GOG implicitly.
3. **Opening maps include terrain.** Plage00/Plage01 have BSP/model objects, many static meshes, and TerrainInfo/TerrainSector exports. A static-mesh-only importer is insufficient.
4. **Animation is inside `.u` packages.** `system/PC/xiiipersos.u` contains skeletal meshes and MeshAnimation exports. The convenient UModel compatibility table does not promise XIII animation or static-mesh support.
5. **Gameplay source text is stripped.** The inspected game-specific TextBuffers are tiny placeholders, while class/function/state metadata remains. Plan a bytecode/native-API compatibility spike, not automatic source translation. Actual function-bytecode deserialization is unverified.
6. **Audio is a separate subsystem.** The `.uax` files total only about 424 KB; the HX bank/stream files total about 1.86 GB. vgmstream has explicit XIII support upstream, but local decode and sound-ID mapping still need testing.
7. **The runtime must replace engine behavior.** Existing 32-bit DLLs contain native engine/game operations. An x64 Bevy renderer does not make those operations available automatically.
8. **Bevy baseline is current to this research date.** Verified release 0.19.1; tagged MSRV 1.95.0; optional Avian 0.7 targets Bevy 0.19 upstream. No local native build has proved that stack yet.

## Locations

| Purpose | Windows | WSL |
|---|---|---|
| Project | `P:\AI\XIII` | `/mnt/p/AI/XIII` |
| GOG baseline | `P:\AI\XIII\XIII_Game` | `/mnt/p/AI/XIII/XIII_Game` |
| Patched Steam comparison | `P:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\XIII - Classic` | `/mnt/p/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/XIII - Classic` |

Native Windows reports an RTX 4090. Rust/Cargo were not found on the inspected WSL or Windows PATH. Windows's standard Visual Studio installation locator was absent. Recheck before installing; absence from PATH is not proof of no installation.

## Exact next work

When implementation is authorized, begin **M0/M1**, then resolve all three M2 risks before investing in a polished viewer.

1. Inspect the existing host toolchains and prepare a native Windows Rust/MSVC build. Pin the verified release versions. Run a minimal native Bevy graphics/input/audio smoke test and document the outcome.
2. Create a small Rust workspace for the package library, inspection CLI and Bevy app. Start with names/imports/exports and full summary metadata; compare to the saved inventory. Add malformed-input fixtures and keep parser errors contextual.
3. Implement explicit installation resolution and actual object-property/default handling. Prove that GOG's `system/PC` data and Steam's nested maps resolve correctly without blending profiles.
4. Select `StaticPlage2.usx` plus Plage00/Plage01 for the world spike; `xiiipersos.u` for animation; `xidmaps.u`/`xiii.u`/`xidcine.u` for compiled logic. Retrieve exact source reference files from the pinned URLs as needed.
5. Establish original-engine reference captures from an isolated writable working copy. Determine precise opening progression, coordinate scale, movement and event timing.

Do not stop at a generic Bevy FPS sample. The central deliverable is loading and running this game's real content. Also do not report full feasibility solved until actual mesh/animation/script payloads work.

## Validation completed

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| GOG inventory | 344 asset/binary/INI hashes; 196 package-table parses; 0 errors |
| Steam local inventory | 376 asset/binary/INI hashes; 213 package-table parses; 0 errors |
| Unique asset-basename comparison | 310 identical, 4 different, 17 Steam-only, 0 GOG-only, 0 ambiguous |
| GOG top-level imported package stems | 0 missing stems; object-level resolution not tested |
| Focus metadata | 8 packages reread and matched to baseline hashes |
| Synthetic research-tool suite | 8 tests passed |
| Geometry / animation / scripts / audio / native Windows runtime | Not implemented or tested |

The script tests only verify the research reader's implemented boundaries. They are not a full fuzzing campaign, a complete package validator or evidence of decoded assets. See `DEVELOPMENT.md` for reproducible commands.

## Update this file when continuing

Replace the current-state and next-work sections as implementation advances. Record exact commands/tests, successful maps/behaviors, unsupported cases, changed dependency versions and any architectural decision. Keep completed measurements distinct from proposals. Preserve the original-installation and source-provenance rules.
